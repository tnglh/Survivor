# Survivor
Project inspired by "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk" : "https://github.com/tnglh/Survivor"
I've extended its functionality by adding new mechanics and player options. Now players can now move forward and backward, enhancing the range of movement and interaction within the game. I added a collectible weapon a gun, that players can acquire the bullet by opening chests. Additionally, players now have multiple lives, allowing for a more immersive and challenging experience
